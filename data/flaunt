<h1>Flaunt</h1>
<h2>A CMS to showoff</h2>
<h3>January 2011</h3>
</hgroup>


<p>Flaunt is a server-side web application or CMS, which uses PHP to present and MySQL to store the content. It supports themes, which use a simple API to pull in content. All content is managed inside backend. <a href="http://pedroandsybil.com">pedroandsybil.com</a> is built with it.</p>

<p>The idea for this came when I wanted to make a portfolio website for myself, but it was never made until I had to document a project for a University project. It never was used for a personal website...</p>

<p>Some of the cool features include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The order of the sidebar items can be ordered in the browser by dragging and dropping boxes.</li>
<li>All <span class="high">.css</span> and <span class="high">.js</span> files are automatically included when they are in the correct directory.</li>
<li>The main stylesheet can be editing without any FTP/Terminal nonsense in the backend.</li>
<li>Loads of others...</li>
</ul>

<p>The source can be downloaded/viewed on <a href="https://github.com/whg/flaunt">github</a>, and I also made a profile on <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/flaunt">ohloh</a> for it, where you can see an analysis.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the backend:</p>
