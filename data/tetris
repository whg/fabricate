<p>For my first year programming coursework, I had to write a game. I chose to Tetris.</p>

<p>The game is written in <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a> and the Java application can be played in the browser, <a href="http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~ma901wg/processing/tetris/">here</a>.</p>

<p>When I wrote this, I had been programming for 6 months. The Processing source can be downloaded <a href="http://download.wgallia.com?tetris">here</a>.</p>
