<p>This is a very simple app with a very simple objective; with a collection of images, make a movie. Images are selected, a frame rate is chosen, if the images need scaling they can be and then a movie is make. The app is written in Objective-C and uses QTKit to write the movie.</p>

<p>The app itself looks like this:</p>
