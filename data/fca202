<p>Now and again I like to produce music. I bought one of the cheaper audio interfaces on the market; the <a href="http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/FCA202.aspx"> Begringer FCA202</a>. However, I quickly became quite frustrated with the lack of control it gave, which was just one volume knob for the headphones.</p>

<p>My solution was to re-case it in a VHS case and add extra functionality: a volume knob for both the main out and headphones, mute switches and a switch to select between RCA and TRS connections for input, all of which pretty much did the job.</p>
