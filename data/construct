<h2>Voxel Based Visual Hulls</h2>
<h3>April 2012</h3>

<p>Construct was my final year project at University. It reconstructs 3D objects from multiple views.</p>

<p>Construct creates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">voxel</a> based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_hull">visual hull</a> using the shape-from-silhouette algorithm. Images are taken from known viewpoints, the foreground is extracted and a 3D reconstruction is built. Construct's rendition of a teapot is illustrated below:</p>

<p>Each viewpoint shaves away areas that are outside of the model, with each successive viewpoint creating a model closer to the original shape. This is illustrated below:</p>

<p>The voxel data is stored in an octree data structure, which recursively subdivides itself with each level of detail. Different levels of detail can be seen below:</p>

<p>Along with the 3D reconstruction, I developed a marker detection algorithm to be used for pose estimation, this involved image processing techniques such as convolution and RANSAC. The phases of this can be seen below:</p>

<p>As I wasn't too into 3D reconstruction as topic, the project became more of journey into the separate aspects of the reconstruction, like pose estimation and marker detection. A detailed report was written an can be downloaded/viewed <a href="http://download.fezz.in/fyp_report.pdf">here</a>
