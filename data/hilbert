<p>At one point I became interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-filling_curve">space filling curves</a>. The most prominent of these is the Hilbert curve. I wondered what it looked like when you migrated pixels along the Hilbert curve.</p>

<p>The cool thing about the hilbert curve is that it gets to points
where it tiles your image in interesting ways:</p>

<p>I also wrote my own space filling curve (technically it isn't space filling, but I'm not a Mathematician), it looks like a spiral.</p>
