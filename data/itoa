<h1>ItoA</h1>
<h2>Image to ASCII</h2>
<h3>June 2011</h3>
</hgroup>

<p>During the summer of 2011 I wanted to learn Python and needed a small project, this was what I chose. Using a web interface you can submit an image, either on your filesystem or using a URL, and a ASCII representation is returned.</p>

<p>You can try it with your own images <a href="http://itoa.wgallia.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>The form is processed by a small PHP script, this saves the image on the server, and calls the Python script to create the ASCII file. When the script returns the PHP prints the contents of the file.</p>

<p>The returned text can either be formatted to be viewed in the browser or in a text document, where the line height is different.</p>

<p>Here are some examples, they are best viewed from a distance, click on the images to see the original images:</p>
