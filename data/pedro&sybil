<h1>Pedro & Sybil</h1>
<h2>A hardware/software marriage</h2>
<h3>May 2011</h3>
</hgroup>

<p>Pedro is a plotter and Sybil is the software that directs Pedro. This was my second year project at University.</p>

<p>The idea for the project spawned from the desire to write a beautifully written letter, a letter that would be written with a pen but have the precision only a machine can accomplish.</p>

<p>Pedro is built from basic materials, either custom made or recycled from printers and has the drawing area of A3 sized paper, it can hold a variety of different pen sizes. Connection to the computer is via USB and the electronics are built from basic components, using an Atmel ATmega8 as the micro-controller, which has been programmed in C.</p>

<p>Sybil is a native Mac OS X application written in C++ and Objective-C using openFrameworks. Users can add, preview and manipulate both text and image before sending the data to be plotted. Within Sybil, users can also issue commands to draw primitive shapes via a command line interface.</p>
