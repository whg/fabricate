<h3 id="me">Me</h3>
<p>Born in 1988 I am a male who lives in London. I am pretty interested in computers and programming, though I am usually interested in most things. At the moment (2011) I am a student. You can download my CV <a href="/CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="site">This Site</h3>
<p>This site is built and maintained by <a>fabricate</a>, a small collection of JavaScript and Python which compiles and displays my work. The content on the client side is 100% dynamic, check out the source of this page to prove it.</p>

<p>The site is hosted on a VPS with <a href="http://linode.com">Linode</a>.</p>
