<p>One of my tutors at University created the C++ <a href="http://maximilian.strangeloop.co.uk/">maximilian</a> sound library. For a piece of coursework, we had to do something with it.</p>

<p>I decided to create a maximilian front end, so users could create and modify sounds on the fly. This is facilitated by <a href="https://github.com/whg/ofxTerminal">ofxTerminal</a>, an openFrameworks add-on which creates a command line (which is in an OpenGL window) and allows users to assign callbacks to specific function names.</p>

<p>In maxiFrontEnd, you can create, affect, sequence and visualise sounds. Here is a demonstration video:</p>
