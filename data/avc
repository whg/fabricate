<p>This is a real-time audio visual composition, where sound and image are one and the same thing. The piece is controlled by a computer keyboard where different permutations of a basic algorithm are changed. First the image is composed using a a sine wave and then the resulting image is sent to the sound card. </p>

<p>Unfortunately vimeo down sampled my uploaded <a href="http://vimeo.com/35008344">video</a>, so if you like what you see below and you have the time/bandwidth (300MB) I would encourage you to <a href="http://download.fezz.in?avc">download</a> the video.</p>

<p>Here are a few stills from a live performance:</p>
